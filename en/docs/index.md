# Termux Docs

Welcome to documentation for Termux.

**Currently, [termux wiki site](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page) is the primary place for documentation but there are plans to remove it and move all documentation here instead. The documentation here is in the process of being written and will slowly be updated and contains info that is not available on the wiki site.**
